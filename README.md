# LED Control With Gesture Detection Using ESP32 and MicroPython

This project uses an ESP32 and MicroPython to control the LEDs using gestures. Each raised finger corresponds to a lit LED.

# Materials needed
- ESP32
- 5 LEDs
- 5 resistors of 220 ohms
- Webcam

# Instructions
1. Load the `main.py` file on your ESP32 using an IDE like Thonny.
2. Run the `camara.py` file on your PC using an IDE like Thonny.
3. Connect the hardware according to the program.
4. Observe how the LEDs respond to the gestures made.
